## Trading Strategy Framework
The bot implements a trend-following strategy with technical analysis:

- **Signal Generation**: Uses moving averages, RSI, and trend detection algorithms
- **Position Management**: Supports both long and short positions with smart averaging
- **Multi-timeframe Analysis**: Analyzes different timeframes for signal confirmation
